# Screenshot Instructions

To add a screenshot for the theme:

1. Create a screenshot image (1200x900 pixels recommended)
2. Save it as `screenshot.png` in the theme root directory
3. The image should show a preview of the theme's homepage

You can use any image editing tool to create the screenshot, or take a screenshot of the theme after activation.
